    "Call with Susan, we went over taking numerical methods course at Memorial. I honestly don't think its a good idea to try to do this hard of a course remotely again but Susan thinks it will be detrimental to my thesis if i dont get a numerical methods course in before beginning research. Will inquire whether or not i can audit a course at another university so that i get the numnerical methods expereince without the stress level of it being for marks. Then, next year when the UBC numerical methods course is offered in term two I can take it for credit. Hopefully this is a viable solution!!"

Centered around whatever the student wants to learn and can be condensed into 1 month since the content is smaller. Sounds pretty interesting/beneficial.

I realise that i know how to run an emssemble model to test the efficacy of difference NN configurations but i actually have no idea how to apply this to new input data in order to get an output. This is relevant for both the assignment and my final project, so I should ask in lab tomorrow. <br>\n",

After talking about why is might be complicated for my dataset for a while we decided that i should instead just extract all the values I need instead of trying to continue to work with this within an xarray (since there are data variables for lat and lon why stress over getting the data coordinates into the correct projection just to have it in xarray). Excited about this new plan - to attempt tomorrow. <br>\n",
    "Also went over how to fix my ignore file to stop sending things that i have already cimmited before but have since put in my ignore file. Turns out that this is because, since they have been committed before, that git still tracks them. Must look into equivalent \"forget\" command to stop this tracking. For large files that i accidentaly included in the commit, another step is required because due to their size they will continue to cause problems for commit even when i stop traking them. "

According to Valentina that needs to be some within the enssemble model loop link as a seperate saved item (like you thought but need to fix your code). Cole mentionned that there may be a way to save model parameters of the best model adn the weights that arose after training. Something called pickle. He gave me a few lines of code that i should try to work with on assignment 4 before applying to project. "

    "Really benficial call with Everett about my EOSC 510 project. Suggested that I treat the MLR that we loop though in class be treated more like an architecture selection method instead of an ensemblre creation. Bassically based on how we do it in class that model with the lowest RMSE (not the ensemble) SHOULD continue to have the lowest RMSE (as long as not too much new data is added (if a lot is then check if RMSE hasn't changed that much and if it has then loop thorugh training again). Also showed me how to exrtact each model from this loop instead of having to re-train again every time. Significantly faster now. <br>\n",
