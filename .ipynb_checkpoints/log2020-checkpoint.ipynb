This is because most animals actually for their shells using calcite, which has a much lower saturation depth. We think that when yound, animals start with using aragonite and switch to catcite later in their development. At low calcite/aragonite the animals can still form shells BUT need to continuously work on forming their shells while their shells keep dissolving. <br>\n",

Transect either within JDF to see flow there or at entrance to the Pacific to see exchange with ocean (or both?). Very exciting! <br>\n",
